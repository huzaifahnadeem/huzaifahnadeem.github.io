# About Me:
Welcome to my webpage. My name is Huzaifah Nadeem. I am a 3rd year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. At Pitt, I am an advisee of [Dr. Amy Babay](https://sites.pitt.edu/~babay/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I have a variety of interests, but lately I have been working with Distributed Systems, Formal Verification, and Quantum Networks. 

Before Pitt, I studied at [Lahore University of Management Science (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in Lahore, Pakistan. From there, I got my BS in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
