# About Me:
Welcome to my webpage. My name is Huzaifah Nadeem. I am a 3rd year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh. I have a variety of interests but lately I have been working with Distributed Systems, Formal Verification, and Quantum Networks. 

Before Pitt, I studied at Lahore University of Management Science (LUMS) in Lahore, Pakistan. From there, I got my BS in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
